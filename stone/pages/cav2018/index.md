#  Model Generation for Quantified Formulas:<br />A Taint-Based Approach

Benjamin Farinier, SÃ©bastien Bardin, Richard Bonichon, and Marie-Laure Potet

We focus in this paper on generating models of quantified first-order formulas
over built-in theories, which is paramount in software verification and bug
finding. While standard methods are either geared toward proving the absence of
solution or targeted to specific theories, we propose a generic approach based
on a reduction to the quantifier-free case. Our technique allows thus to reuse
all the efficient machinery developed for that context. Experiments show a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
